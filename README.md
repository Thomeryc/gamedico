# In here, you will find a game that i've developped in Python 3.8.8.
The primary goal of this game is to find words from the french dictionnary that you can create using a modular grid with some random letters in it, rules are simple :

There is a preset dictionnary stored in a set (or a list it depends the version of the game actually).
Then, a grid appears at the screen with some randoms generated letters in it and users starts to find all the french words they can make with those letters by making proposition with they keyboard.
The script will accept or not the word depending on if the words proposed by the user is in the dictionnary or not.
At the end, the script will show at the user all the words that he could have made from this grid and tell him his score.
